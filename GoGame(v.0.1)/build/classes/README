HOW-TO Play:

Capture as much land as you can. When you surround the other players pieces 
completely they disapear and it is your land. At the end you get one point for
each piece you capture and one point for each piece of land you have surrounded.

To pass a turn hold down the control button and click the mouse anywhere on the
board. (NOTE THAT LIKE A NORMAL GO GAME THE ONLY WAY TO END AND FOR THE GAME TO BE
SCORED IS FOR BOTH PLAYERS TO PASS IN A ROW)
