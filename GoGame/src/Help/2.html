Each stone must have at least one "dame" (point of freedom, 
respiratory item) - adjacent vertically or horizontally 
idle point. Nearby a continuous chain related neighbors 
stones form a group and share each other dames (that is, 
any dame of any stone group refers simultaneously 
to all the stones of this group).

The circles are labeled dames of white group
squares - dames of black groups.
