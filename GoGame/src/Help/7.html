At the end of the rules, but there is another important 
principle, which introduces all beginners.
<br>
Take a look at the chart:
<br><img src = "7.jpg"></img><br>
Each group has a black two separate dame inside. 
Such a dame called eyes. White by the rules can not walk 
into the black group is - suicide, since then black has two dame, 
which it is impossible to capture, that such a group - immortal.
<br>
What can be said about a group with one eye:
<br><img src = "8.jpg"></img><br>
White can go to the eye, because it takes a group of black.
<br>
This is a fundamental principle of Go: being surrounded by 
a group with one eye is dead, the group with two eyes - alive.
 Note that the presence of the third, fourth and so on eye does
 not affect the status of the group - it remains alive.
