# GoGame
Game Go - one of the most interesting and challenging board logic games. 
Despite its prevalence, there is not such a large number of applications for the game of Go.
At the moment, the client-server applications have become ubiquitous, 
so being able to play on the network is simply necessary for a gaming application.
My task was to write a client-server application for playing Go and study of issues 
related to the theory of Go and subtleties of the rules.
